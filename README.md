# Code samples

This repository contains two recent code samples:
* `training-interpretability`: A reproduction of induction heads and capturing of gradients for analyzing their formation.
* `training-process-transparency`: A slightly older experiment in training a 3-layer model from scratch and identifying mono- and polysemantic neurons directly from gradient analysis.
